#  Procrastination Station üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TEAM OP


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abraham Jeyakumar - NSS College Of Engineering 
- Member 2: Anwita K Menon - NSS College Of Engineering
- Member 3: Aravind Sunil -NSS College Of Engineering

### Project Description
Make people Happy

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
SOFTWARE:-Problem is for people that gets bored out and for people that zone out suddenly
HARDWARE:- To detect incoming cell phone calls 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
- By making a website that generate random funny dark humour quotes that will cheer up people in real time
- By making a cell phone signal incoming detector using just one op-amp


### Technologies/Components Used
-For Software:-
 html,python,proteus
Libraries used :- VSCODE
- For Hardware-
- LM358,Resistor,Potentiometer,Capacitor,BC548,LED,Antenna,Power Supply
- 1 KŒ©, 220 K Œ©, 2.2 M Œ© are the resistors used ,. The capacitors are of value 1 ŒºF and 100 ŒºF. For DC Power Supply we have provided a battery with 4.5V 
- Tools required are proteus, multimeter, DC Power Supply

### Implementation
For Software: Used VSCode for most of the coding works. And worked with Proteus 8 Professional while working out with the hardware

Mobile-Phone-Detector-Circuit-using-Op-Amp

The Op-amp part of the circuit acts as the RF Signal Detector while Transistor part of the circuit act as the indicator. The capacitors collection along with the antenna are used to detect RF Signals when a cell phone makes (or receives) a phone call or sends (or receives) a text message .Op-Amp reads the signals by converting the rise in current at input to voltage at output and the LED will be activated.
